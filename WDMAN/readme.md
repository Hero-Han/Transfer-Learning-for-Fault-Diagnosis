# Transfer Learning for Fault Diagnosis 
The detail of WDMAN can be find in the following paper.

[A Deep Transfer Model With Wasserstein Distance Guided Multi-Adversarial Networks for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Different Working Conditions]

For better understanding, we run an example. The accuracy curve is shown as follows:

The WD distance during the transfer period is presented as follows:

Requestments:
you can pip or conda the toolkits in the requestments.txt
or run pip install -r requirements.txt

Issues:
"Load failed" is a note, not a bug, you can run this code normally.
