# Transfer Learning for Fault Diagnosis 
# 迁移学习 故障诊断 深度神经网络

This repository is for the transfer learning or domain adaptive with fault diagnosis. 

It should be notice that we use the tensorflow 1.15. If one use the lastest tensorflow, there will be some errors.

The paper is as follow:

[Domain Adaptation with Multilayer Adversarial Learning for Fault Diagnosis of Gearbox under Multiple Operating Conditions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8943056)

[A Deep Transfer Model With Wasserstein Distance Guided Multi-Adversarial Networks for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Different Working Conditions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8713860)

[Research on variational mode decomposition in rolling bearings fault diagnosis of the multistage centrifugal pump](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327017300754)
